        Alright, so you want to know more about the mind behind the curtain that
        is this website? You are in the right place.
      </p>
      <h2>What is your name?</h2>
      <p>
        My legal name shall remain unknown, but my closest friends call me
        Valentin, and that is what I prefer to go by these days, so let's say my
        name is Valentin
      </p>
      <h2>Describe yourself a little bit?</h2>
      <p>
        Right-o. As you may have noticed from some of my posts, I am not a
        native English speaker. I try to keep the mistakes at a minimum, and my
        writing as nice and legible as possible, but even so, mistakes do
        happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in 1997 (I'll leave it up to you to calculate my age. I am
        old, alright!) and I have been programming since the age of 11, but
        really started hardcore at it when I turned 13.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current residence is in the Netherlands. I primarily speak Dutch and
        English, but I also know my way around Russian and German a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my daily life, I am a student. I study several different
        specialisations within IT. My specialisations, once I am done studying,
        should be Big Data, Hacking, Networking and Programming with a siding of
        Project Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides studying, I also work as a web developer at a startup in the
        Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I only have a certification in Python from our local self study
        course provider. This does not mean that I am any good at it, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I am a proud Aspie. For the people who don't know what that
        means: Asperger's is a high-functioning form of Autism Spectrum
        Disorder. Yes, I am autistic. Take it or leave it.

      <h2>What is this website for?</h2>
      <p>
        This website was originally a side project for me to prove to my teacher
        that I had the necessary skills to pass cybersecurity class. In the end,
        I didn't use the website for this as a report was easier and quicker to
        write. I will be publishing excerpts from my reports on this website,
        however, as will I do with the majority of the notes I take during my
        study.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always had a passion for teaching people how to do things. I
        wanted to combine this with my experience in IT to make a website that
        people could actually use as something to learn from.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal with this website, in the end, is to provide a comprehensive
        overview of the IT topics that I have learnt throughout my years of
        working in the field. This includes courses I take online and offline
        and experience I build up at my job. I might also include the occasional
        hobby project in here just for fun.
